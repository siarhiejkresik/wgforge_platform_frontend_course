          <h3>Multiple game modes</h3>
          <p>
            World of Tanks: Xbox 360 Edition offers three distinct game modes: Standard, Encounter,
            and Assault. Standard battles are intense "capture" scenarios where two teams attempt to
            secure the opposing base. Encounter battles offer only one base to capture, and teams
            fight tooth-and-nail to keep it. In Assault mode, players get a pitched battle between
            attackers and defenders during a single-base engagement.
